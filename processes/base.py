"""
Process-layer ABCs — channel-agnostic contracts for monitor and prompt strategies.

Each channel adapter (slack/, whatsapp/, teams/) must implement these interfaces.
Internal code should dispatch via ``processes/factory.py``, never import a
specific channel's strategy directly.

Mirrors the ``messaging/base.py`` pattern: ABCs here, implementations in
per-channel subdirectories, factory picks the right one at runtime.
